# Storing octal and hexadecimal number
x = 0o25
y = 0x39

# Converting into decimal or int number
a = int(x)
b = int(y)

# And here adding number and converting into binary number
print(bin(a+b))

#OR
print(bin(0o25)+bin(0o39))

# So adding two different form of number
# here octal + hexadecimal number
